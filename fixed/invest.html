			<h2>Elements of Fixed-Income Securities <a href="" class="p1" onclick="printDiv('b1')"><img src="../images/emblem_print(1).png" alt="print" width="25" height="25"/></a></h2>
			<br />
			<h3>
				Introduction
			</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Fixed-income securities are the most prevalent mans of raising capitals globally. The issuer of these <em>bonds</em> promises contractural payments of principals and <strong>coupons</strong> (periodic payments). There are three elements that define the risks, returns, and cash flow schedules of these securities. We advise investors to review these three elements before investing:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The bond's features, including the issuer, maturity, par value, coupon rate, and frequency;</li>
				<li>The legal, regulatory, and tax considerations; and</li>
				<li>The <strong>contingency provisions</strong>, which give the issuer or the bondholders certain rights</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h3>
				Basic Features of a Bond
			</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				We advise investors to review these six important features, which characterize all kinds of bonds.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				1. Issuer
			</h4>
			<p>
				This refers to the entity that issues the bonds. This is important as different issuers have different <a href="../fixed/credit.html">credit risks</a>. Major types of issuers include the following:
			</p>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Supranational organizations</strong>: or international entity, such as the World Bank;</li>
				<li>Sovereign government: a national entity, such as the United States;</li>
				<li><strong>Non-sovereign government</strong>: a state or city of a nation, such as Seoul, South Korea;</li>
				<li><strong>Quasi-government entity</strong>: an agency that is owned or sponsored by governments, such as Fannie Mae; and</li>
				<li>Corporate issuer: a firm or company, such as Google</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<p>
				For corporate bonds, the issuer is usually the corporate legal entity, but its subsidiary may issue a bond, on which case the subsidiary's credit quality sould be reviewed. For securitized bonds, the issuer is <strong>special purpose vehicle (SPV)</strong>.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				2. Maturity
			</h4>
			<p>
				The maturity date is the date when the issuer is obligated to make the promised payments to bondholders. A related term, <strong>tenor</strong> refers to the time remaining until the bond's maturity date. When the bond has the tenor of less than one year, the bond is a <strong>money market security</strong>. In contrast, when the original tenor is longer than one year, the bond is a <strong>capital market security</strong>. As explained in "Contingency Provisions", not all bonds last until the maturity.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				3. Par value
			</h4>
			<p>
				The <strong>par value</strong>--also known as, <strong>principal</strong> and <strong>face value</strong>--refers to a bond amount that the issuer agrees to repay the bondholders on the maturity date. Bond prices are often quoted as a percentage of their par value. A bond with a quote price of 90 and par value of $1,000 is priced at $900 (90% of $1,000). When the bond price is equal to the principal, the bond is trading <strong>at par</strong>. If the bond price is lower than the principal, the bond is trading at a <strong>discount</strong>; if above, it is at a <strong>premium</strong>.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				4. Coupon rates
			</h4>
			<p>
				Most popular bonds are <strong>plain vanilla bonds</strong>, which have fixed coupon rates. However, a variety of coupon payment structures exists to meet the differing needs of issuers and investors.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				For example, <strong>floating-rate notes (FRNs)</strong>, or <strong>floaters</strong> have a floating rate of interest. Generally, a coupon rate of a FRN includes two components: a reference rate and a spread. The reference rate is a widely-used rate, and it varies over time. The most popular reference rate is <strong>London interbank offer rate (Libor)</strong>, which is a benchmark rate that some of the world&rsquo;s leading banks charge each other for short-term loans. On the other hand, the <strong>spread</strong> is usually fixed rate expressed in <strong>basis points (bps)</strong>, the unit equivalent to 0.01%. The coupon rates of FRNs are the sum of the reference rate and the spread. FRN's prices have less exposure to interest rate move, as the coupon rate reflects changing overall yields in the market.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				A bond's coupons can vary with something other than interest rates. With a <strong>credit-linked coupon bond</strong>, bondholders get a certain increase (decrease) in basis points for every credit downgrade (upgrade) of the entity. Another example is an <strong>inflation-linked bond</strong>, which links the bond's coupon rates with inflation rate. The most well-known bond of this kind is <strong>Treasury inflation-protected security (TIPS)</strong>, of which coupon rates are linked to the U.S. CPI.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<strong>Deferred coupon bonds</strong> pay no coupons for its first few years, but then pays a higher coupon later on. An example is a <strong>zero-coupon bond</strong>, which pays no periodic coupons but rewards with a substantially higher principal.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				 Lastly, there is a <strong>step-up coupon bonds</strong>, which increases by specific margins at specific dates. If it is also floating, the spread between coupon rate and the reference rate increases over time.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				5. Coupon frequency
			</h4>
			<p>
				The coupon rate is the interest rate that the issuer agrees to pay each year until the maturity date. The bonds can be issued at any frequency, but most are paid either annually, semiannually, or quarterly. Almost all FRNs have quarterly coupons.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				6. Currency denomination
			</h4>
			<p>
				The issuer is not restricted to issue bonds domestically. Some entities issue bonds in foreign currency to improve its liquidity or to attract foreign investors. There are many types of these bonds. For example, <strong>dual-currency bonds</strong> pay coupons in one currency and par value at maturity in another. <strong>Currency option bonds</strong> give bondholders right to choose the curency in which they will be paid for each interest or principal payments.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h3>
				Legal, Regulatory, and Tax Considerations
			</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				Since a bond is a contractural agreement, investors need to review the contract and the regulatory forces that govern it.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Bond indenture
			</h4>
			<p>
				The <strong>bond indenture</strong> is a bond's <strong>trust deed</strong>, a legal contract that describes (1) the form of the bond, (2) the obligation of the issuer, and (3) the rights of the bondholders. The indenture is held by a <strong>trustee</strong>, who monitors the issuer's complaince with the specified obligations. The bond indenture specifies the following:
			</p>
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>The legal idenitity of the bond issuer and its legal form</li>
				<br />
				<li>The source of repayment proceeds</li>
				<ul>
				<ul>
					<li>Describes how the issuer intends to service the debt</li>
					<li><em>Sovereign</em> bonds: backed by the "full faith and credit" of the national government, which raises tax revenues and prints money.</li>
					<li><em>Non-sovereign</em> bonds: services the debt with taxes and cash flows of the project the bond is financing</li>
					<li><em>Corporate</em> bonds: services primarily through its business operations</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<li>The asset or collateral backing (if any)</li>
				<ul>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Collateral</strong> is the asset that a lender can seize upon default. Some issuers "collateralizes" their bonds in order to alleviate credit risk. <strong>Secured bonds</strong> are bonds backed by collaterals or financial guarantees pledged to ensure debt repayment in the case of default.</li>
					<li><em>Seniority ranking</em>: Since bondholders have only general claims on the issuer's assets and cash flows without collateral, <em>unsecured bonds</em> are paid after secured bonds upon default.</li>
					<li><strong>Debentures</strong>: Usually unsecured bonds backed by reputation and integrity of the entity (e.g. Treasury bonds)--when unsecured, it is called <em>naked</em> debenture; when secured, <em>mortgage</em> debenture</li>
					<li><strong>Covered bonds</strong>: Bonds backed by a separated group of assets called a "cover pool"</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<li>The credit enhancement (if any)</li>
				<ul>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Credit enhancement</strong> refers to a variety of provisions that can be used to reduce the credit risk of a bond issue. There are two types of credit enhancement: internal and external</li>
					<li>Internal credit enhancement: Relies on structural features regarding the priority of payment (e.g., <strong>subordination</strong>, which allocates the cash flows into classes with different repayment priorities), or the value of the collateral (e.g., <strong>over collateralization</strong>, which is the process of posting collateral of higher value than the principal)</li>
					<li>External credit enhancement: Relies on guarantees received from a third party (e.g., <strong>surety bonds</strong> from insurance company, which promises to reimburse investors for losses; or, <strong>bank guarantee</strong>, a surety bonds equivalent from banks)</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
				<br />
				<li>The covenants (if any)</li>
				<ul>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Bond covenants</strong> are legally enforceable rules that borrowers and lenders agree on at the time of a <em>new</em> bond issue</li>
					<li><strong>Affirmative covenants</strong> list what issuers are required to do (e.g., compliance to the rules)</li>
					<li><strong>Negative covenants</strong> put restrictions, including limit of additional debt, and <em>negative pledge</em> (prevent the issuance of debt senior to existing debts). In essence, negative covenants ensure the isuer will not take any actions that would siginificantly reduce its ability to honor the debt.</li>
				</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Legal and Regulatory Considerations
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed-income securities are subject to different legal requirements depending on where they are issued and traded, as well as who holds them.</li>
				<li><strong>Domestic bonds</strong>: Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in that country</li>
				<li><strong>Foreign bonds</strong>: Bonds issued by entities that are incorporated in another country and registered foreign regulatory organizations (e.g., SEC in U.S.)</li>
				<li><strong>Eurobonds</strong> are bonds issued outside the jurisdiction of any single currency; these bonds usually bypass the law and tax constraints, and the trustees do not keep records of who owns the bonds.</li>
				<li><strong>Global Bonds</strong>: Bonds issued simultaneously in Eurobond market and in at least one domestic bond market</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Tax Considerations
			</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>In general, the interest income from a bond investment is taxed at the ordinary income tax rate.</li>
				<li><strong>Capital gain</strong>, which is the extra income from selling a bond at a higher price than expected, is treated differently from taxable income.</li>
				<li>Different rules apply for bonds selling at a discount or premium. In the United States, a prorated portion of the discount must be included in interest income every tax year; the bond issued at a premium provides a tax deduction each year.</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			<h3>
				Contingency Provisions
			</h3>
			<br />
			<p>
				A <strong>contingency provision</strong> is a clause in a legal document that gives a certain right when a certain event occurs. Some contingency provisions come with an <strong>embedded option</strong>, which provides the issuer or shareholders a choice upon an occurrence of the event but cannot be sold separately with the underlying asset. Others, like <em>warrant</em>, can be sold separately.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Callable bonds
			</h4>
			<p>
				With a <strong>callable bonds</strong>, the <em>issuer</em> can buy back all or part of the bond before the specified maturity date. The issuer often uses this option when the issuer can refinance the debt at a lower interest rate, either because the interest rate has decreased or its credit rating has improved. However, issuers may not decide to use the call option if it deems refinancing difficult, for example due to a financial crisis. Investors need to review the indenture, which specifies the <strong>call price</strong>, the amount at which the issuer needs to pay the bondholders upon using the call option; the call price may be higher than the bond price implied by the yield. Some options have <strong>call protection period</strong>, also known as <strong>lockout period</strong>, during which the issuers cannot call the bond. Because the callable bonds are beneficial to the issuer, the price of callable bonds is lower than a similar <strong>straight bond</strong>, an option-free bond.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Putable bonds
			</h4>
			<p>
				<strong>Putable bonds</strong> give the bondholders the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at a pre-determined price on specified dates. The price of putable bonds is higher than a similar straight bond.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Convertible bonds
			</h4>
			<p>
				A <strong>convertible bond</strong> is a bond with embedded equity call options, thus giving the bondholder the right to exchange the bond for a specified number of common shares in the issuing company. Compared to purchasing shares, invetors receive downside protection with a convertible bond, which offers the comfort of regular coupon. Thus, a convertible bond is more expensive than a straight bond, or the equivalent shares. Investors need to review <strong>conversion ratio</strong>, the number of common shares that each bond can be converted into.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h4>
				Warrant
			</h4>
			<p>
				A <strong>warrant</strong> is similar to a convertible bond, but the conversion option is "attached", rather than embedded.

		<h3>
			Yield to Maturity 
		</h3>
		<br />
		<p>
			The most commonly referenced yield measure is <strong>yield to maturity</strong>, which is the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond's expected cash flows until maturity with the bond's price. Since higher yield decreass the present value of future cash flows, there is an inverse relationship between bond's price and its yield to maturity have.
